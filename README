PropEditor program 

Running the program: 


Main screen: 
Clicking 'Open File' button opens a [text box] file dialog, defaulting to the sdcard); enter the name of a build.prop type file on the sdcard. (cp /system/build.prop /sdcard/build.prop first)
	Opening anything other than a readable *.prop file (based on extension only) will result in an error. 


Editor screen: 
Clicking on a property will give a Suggestion list of values for the clicked property; the suggestion file is less sparse at this time but many properties have only one suggestion. 
Clicking menu->Add will give a Suggestion screen of new properties to add to the file (all property names are suggested, duplicating an existing property wil overwrite). 
Pressing back will return to the Main screen, abandoning changes.
Clicking save saves the file under its current name, saveas opens the filename input to save. 
	there is no name checking on the save (so you can saveas build.prop.bak). 

Suggestion list: 
Pressing the back button  will return to the Editor screen; 
Clicking a suggested VALUE will change the selected entry and return to the Editor screen; Selecting "Manual entry" will pop up a manual entry dialog.
Clicking a suggested NAME (from Add in editor) will suggest values per above for the new property. 


Merge: 
With an existing build.prop open, you can 'merge' another build.prop file to overwrite/add the settings in it. This should make it easy for users with a list of common changes to modify their build.prop 
after flashing a new CM (or other) update. 

Example: 

have /sdcard/mergeme.prop with

ro.product.model=T-Mobile G1
ro.product.name=opal

to make T-Mobile apps work (cm5 default for model being HTC Dream) and Facebook Sync work

cp /system/build.prop /sdcard

open /sdcard/build.trout.prop with PropEditor
menu->merge, pick /sdcard/mergeme.prop
menu->save

*visually verify it worked, this is still experimental*

[remount /system readwrite]
cp /sdcard/build.prop /system/build.prop



you can download a compiled .apk version from the 'homepage' above; 'unknown sources' has to be checked, use astro or similar to install from sdcard.
